# Ashfire

__Ashfire__ is a compiler for __Firelang__, an [Concatenative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language) [Stack-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) programming language that compiles to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/).

All thanks to [Tsoding](https://github.com/rexim), as this project is Heavily inspired by [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth).

## Firelang

This compiler is a WIP port of the [Firesharp](https://github.com/LunaAmora/Firesharp) compiler to rust. The language specification is frozen until parity between compilers is achieved.
